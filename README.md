# 🐦Flock: connect through shared interests

*At Flock, we believe that if you care about in something, someone else cares about it too. Let's get you connected.*


## 📒 Project outline

### 🔍Problem statement

Millions of people in the UK are significantly affected by loneliness. Many organisations are already doing amazing work to help address this complex issue. There isn't just one solution. It can't be solved by an app, or even tech, alone. 

There are numerous reasons why people feel isolated and lonely. For some, it might be easy to chat to someone but maybe they can't find the right space to meet. Others may find it difficult striking up a conversation; it's difficult to reach out.

### 💡 (Part of the) solution

**Flock** is our contribution to help combat loneliness. It's a safe space for adults (18+) to:

* **Connect through shared interests:** join groups based on your passions.
* **Start conversations:** use built-in prompts and features to break the ice.
* **Discover events:** find meet-ups and events happening in your area.

**Join our community and find your flock!**
